During my studies at ECE, my team and I worked on implementing the Breadth-First Search (BFS) algorithm to find a path from an initial state to a final state in a graph. 
We used NetworkX and Matplotlib to visualize the algorithmâ€™s performance and results, providing a clear representation of the search process and its applications.
